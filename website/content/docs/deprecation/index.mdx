# Feature Deprecation Notice and Plans

This announcement page is maintained and updated periodically to communicate important decisions made concerning End of Support(EoS) for Vault features as well as features we have removed or disabled from the product. We document the removal of features, enable the community with a plan and timeline for eventual deprecations, and supply alternative paths to explore and evaluate to minimize business disruptions. If you have questions or concerns about a deprecated feature, please create a topic on [the community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/vault/30) or raise a ticket with your support team. Please refer to the [FAQ](/docs/deprecation/faq) page for frequently asked questions concerning Vault feature deprecations.

## Deprecation Status

As of version 1.12, Vault implements a multi-phased approach to deprecation. The intent of this approach is to provide sufficient warning that a feature will be removed and safe handling of stored data when the associated feature has been removed.

The phases of deprecation are also known as "Deprecation Status". These statuses are currently reflected in builtin plugins and are exposed via the Vault `auth`, `secrets`, and `plugins` CLI/API endpoints. For more information, refer to the corresponding documentation.

The four phases of deprecation are: `Supported`, `Deprecated`, `Pending Removal`, and `Removed`.

### Supported

This is the default status and reflects a feature which is still supported. There is no unique behavior or functionality associated with this status.

### Deprecated

This status reflects a feature which has been marked for deprecation in a later release of Vault. This is the first phase of the deprecation process. A status of `Deprecated` has two effects:

1. After an upgrade, any existing `Deprecated` mount will log `Warn`-level messages on unseal.

2. All new `Deprecated` mounts will log `Warn`-level messages.

3. All `POST/GET/LIST` endpoints associated with this mount will return `warnings` in response data.

### Pending Removal

This status reflects a feature which has been officially deprecated in this release of Vault. This is the first phase in the process that fundamentally alters the behavior of Vault. The effects are two-fold:

1. After an upgrade, any existing `Pending Removal` mount will log `Error`-level messages to the Vault log and cause an immediate shutdown of the Vault core.

2. Any new `Pending Removal` mounts will fail and log `Error`-level messages to the Vault log and CLI/API.

#### `VAULT_ALLOW_PENDING_REMOVAL_MOUNTS`

The `Pending Removal` behavior may be overriden using a new environment variable: [`VAULT_ALLOW_PENDING_REMOVAL_MOUNTS`](/docs/commands/server#vault_allow_pending_removal_mounts). This environment variable effectively allows all `Pending Removal` mounts to be treated as `Deprecated`.

### Removed

This status reflects a feature which has been officially removed from Vault. `Removed` is the last phase of the deprecation process. During this phase, code for this feature no longer exists within Vault.

1. After an upgrade, any existing `Removed` mount will log `Error`-level messages to the Vault log and cause an immediate shutdown of the Vault core.

2. Any new `Removed` mounts will fail and log `Error`-level messages to the Vault log and CLI/API.

#### Migration Path

In order to successfully upgrade, use of the `Removed` feature must be discontinued. To accomplish this:

1. Downgrade Vault to a previous version.

2. Carefully replace any `Removed` or `Pending Removal` mount with the preferred alternative feature, as shown in the `Migration Path/Impact` column of the table below.

3. Upgrade to latest desired version.

## Feature deprecations

**Deprecation Announcement**: This indicates the release version during which the announcement was made to deprecate a feature.

**End of Support**: This indicates when a deprecated feature becomes unsupported. Consult the table below and consider the timeline provided to upgrade. If you use Vault Enterprise and require help with a deprecated feature, the Vault Support Team will provide limited support. However, we will not provide software patches or bug fixes. Refer to the [HashiCorp Support Policy](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021185113-Support-Period-and-End-of-Life-EOL-Policy) to understand our product support timeline.

**Feature Removal**: This indicates that the feature is completely removed/disabled from the product.

~> **Note**: All specified targeted version announcements for End of Support and Feature Removal may be subject to change.

| SHA-1 certificate signing | v1.11             | v1.11          | v1.12           | Go version 1.18 removes support for SHA-1 by default. As Vault updates its Go version to 1.18, you should plan to move off SHA-1 for certficate signing. Operators can set a Go [environmental variable](/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-is-the-impact-of-removing-support-for-x-509-certificates-with-signatures-that-use-sha-1) to restore SHA-1 support if they need to continue using SHA-1. It is unknown at this time when Go will remove the environmental variable support. Therefore, we highly encourage you to migrate off of SHA-1 for certificate signing. |[FAQ](/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-is-the-impact-of-removing-support-for-x-509-certificates-with-signatures-that-use-sha-1)|
| Consul secrets engine parameter changes  | v1.11     | N/A     | N/A     | The `policies` parameter on the Consul secrets engine has been changed in favor of `consul_policies`. The `token_type` and `policy` parameters have been deprecated as the latest versions of Consul no longer support the older ACL system they were used for. | [Consul secrets engine API documentation](/api-docs/secret/consul) |


*If you use **Standalone DB Engines** or **AppID (OSS)**, you should actively plan to migrate away from their usage. If you use these features and upgrade to Release 1.12, Vault will log error messages and shut down, and any attempts to add new mounts will result in an error.
This behavior may temporarily be overridden when starting the Vault server by using the `VAULT_ALLOW_PENDING_REMOVAL_MOUNTS` environment variable until they are officially removed in Vault version 1.13.
If you are still using these deprecated features and attempt to upgrade to 1.13 (the target feature removal timeframe), you will not be able to start up Vault without downgrading and migrating away from these features.
